1,"the 91 animal species, most of which are native to africa, occur in about 30 genera. the classification of tribes or subfamilies within bovidae is still a matter of debate. the arabian peninsula is home to the arabian oryx and dorcas gazelle. india is hometo nilgai, chinkara, blackbuck, tibetan animal, and four-horned animal.",Antelope
2,"no animal species is native to australasia or antarctica, nor do any extant species occur in the americas. north america is currently home to the native pronghorn, which taxonomists do not consider a member of the animal group. many species of animal have been imported to other parts of the world, especially the united states, for exotic game hunting.",Antelope

4,"animal are ruminants, so have well-developed molar teeth, which grind cud (food balls stored in the stomach) into a pulp for further digestion. most of the ""spiral-horned"" animal have pale, vertical stripes on their backs. many desert and semidesert species are particularly pale, some almost silvery or whitish.",Antelope
5,"the size and shape of animal horns varies greatly. in most species, both sexes have horns, but those of males tend to be larger. horns are not shed and their bony cores are covered with a thick, persistent sheath of horny material, both of which distinguish them from antlers. males more commonly use horns against each other than against another species.",Antelope
6,"animal are often classified by their reproductive behavior. small animal, such as dik-diks, tend to be monogamous. large grazing animal form large herds made up of many females and a single breeding male. springboks use a behavior known as stotting to confuse predators.",Antelope

8,"the animal's horn is prized for supposed medicinal and magical powers in many places. there is no scientific evidence that the horns of any animal have any change on a human's physiology or characteristics. the horn of the male saiga is ground as an aphrodisiac, for which it has been hunted nearly to extinction.",Antelope
9,"animal will consistently display a fear response to perceived predators, such as humans, making them very difficult to herd or handle. this tendency to panic and their nonhierarchical social structure explains why farm-raised animal are uncommon. other animal that have been tamed successfully include the gemsbok, kudu, and springbok.",Antelope

12,"all animal have horns; in some species they are only found on the males. in others, such as gazelles, both males and females have them. horns are permanently attached, unlike a deer’s antlers, which are shed each year. some horns twist in interesting spirals; others are ridged or corrugated.",Antelope

16,"duikers and dik diks live alone, in pairs, or in small groups of between 3 and 10 individuals. dik dik pairs choose a territory and may occupy and defend that same territory for life. animal calves have two survival strategies: hide out to avoid predators or start traveling right after birth to join the protection of the herd.",Antelope
17,"the calves are up and on their feet within a few minutes to a day or so after they are born, and they immediately start traveling with the herd. they often stick together as a group and are protected by adults surrounding them this way they don’t get left behind and can nurse from their mothers. the adults can face the challenge with their strength and their horns if danger approaches.",Antelope
18,"saigas are poached for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional asian folk remedies. the demand far outpaces the supply, driving prices up and making poaching seem worth the risk. in 1994, there were about 1,350,000 saigas in russia; today, there are a mere 65,000, with very few males.",Antelope

21,"animal is more an informal classification than a scientific one. there is no single scientific name that includes all these animals instead, the name animal describes any deer-like animals within the family bovidae that has a similar appearance and physiology. experts can often distinguish animal species based merely on the appearance of their horns. most tend to have a deer-like appearance with spikes or corkscrew horns.",Antelope
22,"there are generally two types of animal, which vary by habitat. small to medium animals such as the duikers and reedbucks are more adapted to concealed cover in forests and wetlands. the larger animals, on the other hand, are built for the deserts, open plains, and savannas.",Antelope
23,"the animal has a multi-chambered stomach filled with specialized bacteria to ferment and break down the tough cellulose of the plant matter. the animal will also regurgitate the food as cud and chew it again with its well-developed molar teeth to aid in digestion. the habitation dictates the survival strategies of each species, from body size to diet to social organization.",Antelope
24,"animals are some of the most common prey animals in africa. they make a tempting meal for cheetahs, lions, hyenas, civets, pythons, and large birds. because of their incredible speed, many predators prefer to sneak up on them and pick off individual stragglers.",Antelope

34,"animal communicate with each other using ‘rump flashes’ (a danger signal), raised hair crests, and audible communications like whistles, barks, moos, and trumpets. scent marking by rubbing their face on grass, trees, stones and logs is also used to claim territory and to lay a path for other members of the herd to follow.",Antelope
35,"animal calves are usually born singly, and animal females native to forested areas will usually hide their young. grassland animal young are born in the open instead, and must gain the ability to stand on their feet within around 15 minutes of birth. loss of habitat, game hunting, poaching, and loss of grazing land to cattle farmers are some of the biggest threats to animal populations.",Antelope
36,"sitatunga (tragelaphus spekei) are amphibious animals associated with wetlands. they have small home ranges close to water and, when threatened by land-based predators, will submerge in water up to the level of their nostrils. the lechwe (kobus leche) has similar adaptations and is distributed across parts of central and southern africa.",Antelope

38,"jarman’s analysis at the species level indicated that group size was positively associated with diet breadth and body mass. species in larger groups tended to flee or counter-attack, rather than hide, when threatened by predators. this study had a large impact on subsequent research despite lacking proper statistical testing. a re-analysis of the data using statistical techniques to control for shared ancestry enables us to re-evaluate these previous qualitative conclusions.",Antelope
39,"the relationship between group size and body size is weaker within than between subfamilies of animals. this suggests a relative lack of flexibility in group size among species with shared ancestry. the arrow of causation remains difficult to establish with simple correlations. for instance, it is not clear whether animal species evolved larger group sizes after or before moving to more open habitats.",Antelope
40,"antipredator traits in animals and other ungulate species have since been related to group living. many of these traits may function as signals to alert other group members of a predation threat. predator inspection, bunching, and group attacks are more predominant in larger species and those living in larger groups.",Antelope
